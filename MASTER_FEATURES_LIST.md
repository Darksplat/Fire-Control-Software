üß± DESIGN & PROTOTYPING PRACTICES
Use KiCad or Eagle for PCB design (2-layer minimum)
Include test points, mounting holes, and silkscreen labels
Isolate high current and sensitive digital traces
Standardize on JST/Screw connectors for modularity
Use heat shrink, strain relief, and proper fuse rating
Breadboard for initial tests, perfboard for stage 2
Label wiring clearly, maintain a pinout reference doc
